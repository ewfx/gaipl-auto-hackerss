    - Designed for easy extensibility, allowing for the addition of new functionalities as needed.

**Platform Assistant:**

A context-aware platform assistant is integrated throughout the portal to provide targeted support and guidance. For example:

- In the **Incident Details** section, the assistant focuses on helping users troubleshoot and resolve incidents efficiently.
- In the **Reporting** section, the assistant is designed to answer reporting queries and provide data insights.

**MCP Server Integration:**

The platform leverages MCP Servers to enable LLMs to perform specific actions and access real-time data. The current Kubernetes MCP Server allows for querying and retrieving pod-related information. This architecture is designed to be highly extensible, allowing for the seamless integration of new MCP Servers and functionalities to meet evolving platform needs.

## üí° Inspiration
We were inspired to create this project after witnessing the challenges faced by platform teams and the fragmented nature of information sources during troubleshooting. Our goal was to create a centralized platform to streamline incident management and provide a unified view of critical system data.

## ‚öôÔ∏è What It Does
This Integrated Platform Management Portal provides a comprehensive, centralized solution for platform teams to efficiently manage and monitor their platforms. Designed to streamline operations and enhance productivity, this portal offers a range of functionalities, all accessible from a single, intuitive interface.

**Key Functionalities:**

- **Incident Management, Troubleshooting, and Resolution:**
    - **What it does:** Provides a unified view of all incidents, categorized by status (open, ongoing, resolved, etc.), enabling platform teams to quickly identify and prioritize critical issues.
    - **Elaboration:** Delivers detailed insights into each incident, including affected applications, underlying system dependencies, and historical data, empowering users to understand the scope and impact of the problem.
    - **Meaningful Action:** Integrates a troubleshooting assistant that offers step-by-step guidance and automated command execution, accelerating the resolution process and minimizing downtime.

- **Configuration Management:**
    - **What it does:** Automates configuration tasks, such as patching, platform updates, and configuration changes, ensuring consistency and compliance across the platform.
    - **Elaboration:** Offers a centralized repository for managing configuration files, policies, and templates, providing a single source of truth for platform configurations.
    - **Meaningful Action:** Reduces manual effort, minimizes configuration drift, and enhances overall platform stability.

- **Monitoring:**
    - **What it does:** Aggregates monitoring data from diverse systems and applications into a single, customizable dashboard, providing a holistic view of platform health and performance.
